Title: The Lost Map of Arendale

SCENE 1 – ARIENDALE VILLAGE, EARLY MORNING
Mira Stone enters the quiet village, holding an old compass and a half-burned map.
VILLAGER (whispering): They say that map leads to the Crystal Caves beneath Blackwood Forest… remnants of the Ashen Concord’s forbidden paths.
Mira ignores the whispers and walks into the inn.

SCENE 2 – VILLAGE INN
Mira meets Elias Thorn, a young scholar surrounded by scrolls.
MIRA: I need someone who can read ancient symbols.
ELIAS: I’ve studied them for years. Let me see the map.
He examines it, eyes widening.
ELIAS: If we leave before sunset, we might reach the forest edge.
Mira nods.

SCENE 3 – LORD VALE’S MANOR
Lord Darrin Vale receives news of Mira’s arrival.
VALE: That map must not reach the caves. Not after what the Ashen Concord cost my family.
He signals to Sergeant Lorne.
VALE: Follow them. Recover the map. No delays.
LORNE: As you command, my lord.

SCENE 4 – RAVEN HILL, STORMY EVENING
Mira and Elias take shelter in an abandoned watchtower as rain lashes the stones.
ELIAS: Look—these carvings match the symbols on the map.
The door slams open. Lorne steps in.
LORNE: In the name of Lord Vale, hand over the map.
A fight erupts. Lightning strikes the tower, setting it ablaze.
MIRA: This way!
She pulls Elias into a hidden tunnel.

SCENE 5 – BLACKWOOD FOREST, DAWN
The tunnel opens into a dense forest glowing with morning mist.
ELIAS: We’re close. I can feel it.

SCENE 6 – THE CRYSTAL CAVES
Blue light reflects off crystal-lined walls.
ELIAS (reading an inscription): The treasure… it’s knowledge. A record of Arendale’s first settlers—truth erased after the Ashen Concord.
Mira places a hand on his shoulder.
MIRA: Then we protect it.

SCENE 7 – CAVE ENTRANCE, LATER
Lord Vale arrives, finding only silence and a single note pinned to a stone.
NOTE (voice-over): “The past belongs to everyone who seeks it with courage.”

Fade out.

SCENE 1 – ARIENDALE VILLAGE, EARLY MORNING
Mira Stone enters the quiet village, holding an old compass and a half-burned map.
VILLAGER (whispering): They say that map leads to the Crystal Caves beneath Blackwood Forest… remnants of the Ashen Concord’s forbidden paths.
Mira ignores the whispers and walks into the inn.

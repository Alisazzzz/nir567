Title: The Lost Map of Arendale

SCENE 1 – ARIENDALE VILLAGE, EARLY MORNING
Mira Stone enters the quiet village, holding an old compass and a half-burned map.
VILLAGER (whispering): They say that map leads to the Crystal Caves beneath Blackwood Forest… remnants of the Ashen Concord’s forbidden paths.
Mira ignores the whispers and walks into the inn.

SCENE 2 – VILLAGE INN
Mira meets Elias Thorn, a young scholar surrounded by scrolls.
MIRA: I need someone who can read ancient symbols.
ELIAS: I’ve studied them for years. Let me see the map.
He examines it, eyes widening.
ELIAS: If we leave before sunset, we might reach the forest edge.
Mira nods.

SCENE 3 – LORD VALE’S MANOR
Lord Darrin Vale receives news of Mira’s arrival.
VALE: That map must not reach the caves. Not after what the Ashen Concord cost my family.
He signals to Sergeant Lorne.
VALE: Follow them. Recover the map. No delays.
LORNE: As you command, my lord.

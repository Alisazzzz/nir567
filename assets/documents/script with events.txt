INT. RUINED FORTRESS HARRON – DUSK

Dust drifts through collapsed archways. LIRA, a map-keeper, runs her fingers over a copper compass. KAEL, a former border guard, watches the shadows.

LIRA
(quietly)
Hard to believe this was once the Garden Hall. Before the Ancient War, these walls were covered in ivy and lantern glass. Travelers said you could hear music from the orchards outside.

KAEL
Now it’s nothing but cracked stone and ash. Ever since the turmoil that followed the war, Harron turned into a grave of its own history.

The compass flickers with a dim, pulsing glow.

LIRA
The compass is reacting again. Something deeper in the fortress… It wasn’t like this before the smuta. Back then, artifacts stayed dormant.

KAEL
(grimly)
After the war tore the continents apart, nothing stayed dormant. Remember the Eastern Ridge? Before the war it was a trading terrace. After… just a sinkhole swallowing caravans whole.
